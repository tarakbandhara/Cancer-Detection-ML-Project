A machine learning project to classify breast cancer tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using diagnostic features from the Breast Cancer dataset.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
Early detection of breast cancer is critical for improving survival rates. This project develops a machine learning pipeline that processes patient diagnostic data and predicts whether a tumor is cancerous or not.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
- **Samples**: 569  
- **Features**: 30 numerical attributes (cell nucleus characteristics)  
- **Target**:  
  - `M` â†’ Malignant (cancerous)  
  - `B` â†’ Benign (non-cancerous)  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- **Training Accuracy** : ~99%
- **Test Accuracy** : ~97%
- **Confusion Matrix** : High precision & recall for both classes
- ***Generalization* : No overfitting â†’ training and test performance are close

  ## ðŸ§© Code Breakdown
  ## 1. Import Libraries
      Handles data, visualization, preprocessing, and model building.
  ## 2. Load & Explore Dataset
      Read data.csv
      Checked missing values
      Previewed rows and data types
  ## 3. Preprocessing
      Dropped irrelevant columns (id, Unnamed: 32)
      Reordered columns to put diagnosis last
      Normalized features with StandardScaler
  ## 4. Train-Test Split
      80% training, 20% testing
      Set random state = 2
  ## 5. Model Training
      Algorithm: Logistic Regression
      Fit on standardized training data
  ## 6. Model Evaluation
      Compared training vs. test accuracy
      Visualized results in a bar chart
      Built confusion matrix
  ## 7. Performance Check
      -- Overfitting/underfitting check based on score gap
  ## 8. Prediction on New Data
      Input patient data vector
      Predicted Malignant/Benign
